Point your phone at a Pokémon card and pokeum tells you **exactly which printing it is** — name, set, and collector number (e.g. *Pikachu · Paldea Evolved · 025/193*) plus print variants like reverse holo or 1st Edition. Scan card after card, build your collection, export it as a TCGplayer-ready CSV.

Fully self-hosted: a FastAPI recognition service plus an installable web app (PWA). No accounts, no cloud dependency, no per-scan fees.

<!-- TODO: screenshots — docs/media/scan.gif (live scan → match sheet) and docs/media/collection.png (collection grid) -->

## Features

- **📸 Live camera scanning** — point, tap, confirm. A guide frame crops the capture; the match sheet shows the card art for a one-tap save. Photo upload works too.
- **🧠 Multi-signal recognition, no per-set training** — perceptual hashes + a fine-tuned DINOv2 image encoder (ONNX, CPU-only at runtime) + OCR of the collector number + set-symbol matching, fused into one confidence-ranked answer. A newly released set becomes recognizable with one data sync — never a retrain.
- **✨ Variant detection** — reverse holo, 1st Edition, shadowless, promo stamps.
- **📱 Installable app** — the website is a PWA: "Add to Home Screen" on Android and iOS gives an app icon, fullscreen launch, offline card art, and a collection that persists on the device.
- **📤 Collection export** — TCGplayer-style CSV or plain text.
- **🔒 Your infrastructure** — one Python service serves both the API and the built frontend as a single origin. Card images come straight from the TCGdex CDN, so the server stays lean (~250 MB of data artifacts).

## Quickstart (self-host)

Requirements: Python 3.13+, Node 22+ (only to build the frontend), ~2 GB disk for the full catalogue on the machine that builds the index.

```bash
# 1. backend deps
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/Scripts/activate   # or bin/activate on Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. reference data: download the card catalogue from TCGdex (once, ~20k cards)
python main.py sync

# 3. precompute the matching index (hashes + embeddings)
python main.py index build

# 4. build the web app
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..

# 5. serve — API under /api, web app at the root
python main.py serve            # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Or skip the frontend and use the CLI directly:

```bash
python main.py identify my_card_photo.jpg
python main.py scan             # live webcam mode
```

Configuration is environment-based with sensible defaults — see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for every key (`python main.py` auto-loads a local `.env`).

> **Camera + install need HTTPS.** Browsers only expose the camera and the PWA install prompt on secure origins. For production put the service behind TLS — a [Cloudflare Tunnel](deploy/README.md) or any reverse proxy works; `localhost` is exempt during development.

### Install it as an app

Open your deployed site on a phone:

- **Android (Chrome):** tap the "Install app" prompt, or ⋮ → *Add to Home screen*.
- **iOS (Safari):** Share → *Add to Home Screen*.

Scanned collections are stored on the device and survive restarts; card art is cached for offline viewing.

## How it works

pokeum never trains a model to recognize cards — it **looks cards up**. Every card has a clean reference image on [TCGdex](https://tcgdex.dev); pokeum downloads those once, fingerprints each (perceptual hashes + embeddings from a **frozen** encoder), and stores them in an index. Recognizing a photo is: find the card's outline, perspective-flatten it, fingerprint it the same way, and take the nearest neighbour — with the OCR'd collector number settling ties between reprints that share artwork.

```

The encoder was fine-tuned once, on synthetic photo distortions (glare, perspective, blur, fingers), to learn that a bad photo of a card *is* that card — it learned to ignore cameras, not to memorize cards, which is why new sets never need training. Runtime inference is ONNX on CPU; PyTorch is never a server dependency.

Deeper docs live in [`openwiki/quickstart.md`](openwiki/quickstart.md) — the recognition pipeline, reference data, service/CLI surface, and the optional training harness.

## Deployment

[`deploy/`](deploy/README.md) contains a production runbook: a systemd unit for the service, a Cloudflare Tunnel example for HTTPS, and the minimal set of data artifacts a server needs (~250 MB — the reference DB, embedding index, ONNX model, and set symbols; card images are served from the TCGdex CDN).

## Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev   # Vite dev server proxying /api to :8000
```

The quality gate (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pytest`) runs via pre-commit and CI; the test suite is fully offline. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This repo also ships a self-enforcing agent workflow (Claude Code and Codex): rules, skills, hooks that gate commits on doc freshness and semver, and agent-oriented docs in `openwiki/`. If you work with coding agents it's a working reference setup — see [`openwiki/workflow.md`](openwiki/workflow.md); if you don't, it stays out of your way.
