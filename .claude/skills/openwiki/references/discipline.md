# OpenWiki run discipline

How to research and behave during any openwiki run. These rules assume Claude Code's native tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, Explore subagents) operating on real repository paths.

## Research discipline

- Ground every important claim in source files, existing docs, or git evidence you have actually inspected. Do not invent files, modules, APIs, business rules, or behavior.
- Do not exhaustively read every file. Inspect: the repository tree, package/config files, README-style files, entrypoints, routing files, database/schema files, and representative files for each major domain.
- Never glob `**/*` from the repository root. Use targeted discovery by directory and extension, excluding `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, cache directories, and the existing `openwiki/` output.
- Prefer Grep/Glob and short targeted Reads over full-file reads when files are large.
- Stay inside the target repository. Do not search parent directories or unrelated repositories.
- Create a strong, accurate, navigable wiki, then stop. It gets refined in later update runs — do not gold-plate the first pass.

## Subagent discipline

- You may use Explore subagents to parallelize read-only research when the repository has multiple substantial domains.
- Default to 1–2 subagents for large or unfamiliar repositories; use 3–4 only when the repo is clearly small/medium with naturally independent domains, or the user asks for deeper research.
- Subagents only inspect and summarize — they never write files. Give each a narrow brief (existing docs, runtime architecture, data/storage, UI/API surface, integrations, tests, business workflows) and ask for concise findings with source paths and open questions.
- Subagent reports are internal discovery notes. You synthesize the final docs and own all writes. Do not paste subagent reports into pages or the final response.

## Planning discipline

- After discovery and before writing final documentation, write a temporary `openwiki/_plan.md` listing: intended pages, source evidence for each page, and remaining questions.
- Delete `openwiki/_plan.md` before completing the run. Never leave it in the final wiki.

## Git discipline

- Use git to explain **why** code exists, not just what exists.
- During init: inspect recent commit history; use `git log`, `git show`, and `git blame` selectively on important files to understand how major workflows, entrypoints, and business rules evolved.
- During update: always inspect commits added since the previous successful run — the helper's `context` and `impact` commands compute this from the `checkedHead` recorded in `openwiki/.last-update.json` (falling back to `updatedAt`). Prefer their output over ad-hoc git archaeology; use raw git to understand *why* the listed files changed, not to re-derive *what* changed.
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to account for uncommitted local changes, especially those touching docs or important source files.
- Do not over-index on ancient history. Focus on recent commits and high-signal history for important files.

## Existing documentation discipline

- Treat existing READMEs, `docs/` trees, root documentation files, runbooks, and SKILL.md files as primary source material.
- Summarize and link to existing docs that are still useful — do not duplicate them wholesale.
- If existing docs conflict with source code or git history, call out the likely-stale documentation and prefer current source evidence.

## Security & scope rules

- Do not read or document secret values, credentials, private keys, tokens, or `.env` files. `.env.example` and other sample config may be read only if it contains placeholders.
- If a secret-bearing file seems relevant, document only that such configuration exists and where non-sensitive setup belongs.
- Keep all documentation under `openwiki/`. Do not modify source code outside `openwiki/` — the only exceptions are top-level `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, and only for the OpenWiki reference section defined in `structure.md`.
