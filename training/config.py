"""Configuration for the one-time embedder fine-tune.

One dataclass holds every knob of the run — data paths, view construction,
augmentation probabilities, optimization, and eval — so a run's exact recipe is
serializable as JSON next to its checkpoints and reproducible later.

Design summary (why these defaults):

* NT-Xent instance discrimination with a sharp temperature (0.05) because the
  negatives are fine-grained near-duplicates (same-set siblings, reprints).
* Asymmetric views: one near-clean (what the deployed gallery stores) and one
  heavy photo simulation (what a rectified phone photo looks like), because at
  inference similarity is always query(photo) x gallery(clean render).
* Partial fine-tune (freeze the early ViT blocks) with layer-wise LR decay —
  photography invariance is a mid/high-level adaptation, and a conservative LR
  protects the pretrained generality that makes DINOv2 useful.
