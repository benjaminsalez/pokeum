"""Pydantic response models for the HTTP API.

These mirror the shape of :meth:`app.models.RecognitionResult.as_dict`, so a
route can build its ``dict`` and let FastAPI validate it against the declared
``response_model``. Keeping the models here gives the OpenAPI schema real types
without duplicating the conversion logic.
