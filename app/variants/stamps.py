"""Promo-stamp detection.

Promotional cards carry a stamp (often a gold/black foil badge) in the lower-left
of the artwork. Detection looks for a compact, high-saturation-or-dark mark that
stands out from the surrounding art. Because stamps vary widely, the threshold is
deliberately high: assert a stamp only on strong evidence, to avoid false
positives on busy artwork.
