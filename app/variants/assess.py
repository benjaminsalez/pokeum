"""Run every applicable variant check on the winning card.

Each detector self-gates (on era or catalogue variant flags) and returns ``None``
when it does not apply, so this aggregator simply runs them and keeps the guesses
that fired. Only the recognized card is assessed — variant checks are too
expensive and too card-specific to run on every candidate.
