"""Reverse-holo detection.

A reverse-holo card foils the whole body *except* the artwork, so the text and
border area sparkles. TCGdex ships a single flat image per card, so detection is
intrinsic rather than comparative: measure high-frequency energy in the card body
and, when the catalogue says a reverse variant exists, judge whether the foil is
present. A single still is weak evidence, so confidence is capped — the webcam
path, aggregating specular changes across frames, is far stronger.
