"""Card detection: find the card's quadrilateral in a photo or frame.

A classic contour approach — blur, edge-detect, find the largest convex quad with
a plausible card size and aspect. It handles the common case (a card on a
contrasting surface) without any trained model, which keeps new sets a pure data
operation. When nothing card-like is found the caller falls back to treating the
whole (already-cropped) image as the card.
