"""Interfaces shared by recognition signals.

Signals turn a rectified card image into per-card scores. The heavy concrete
implementations (an ONNX encoder, an OCR engine) live in sibling modules and are
imported lazily; here we only declare the small structural interfaces the
pipeline depends on, so pure-logic code and tests can inject fakes without ever
loading a model.

The interchange image type is a NumPy ``uint8`` RGB array of shape ``(H, W, 3)``.
